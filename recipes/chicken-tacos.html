        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken breasts with cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. In a large skillet, 
                heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the seasoned chicken breasts and cook for about 6-8 minutes on each side, 
                or until fully cooked. Remove from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes before shredding the chicken with two forks. </li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed, and sauté the diced onion and minced garlic until softened.</li>
            <li>Return the shredded chicken to the skillet and toss with the sautéed onions and garlic. Squeeze lime juice over the chicken mixture 
                and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>In a separate skillet or directly over a gas flame, warm the corn tortillas until they are soft and slightly charred.</li>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with a portion of the shredded chicken. Top with your choice of toppings, such as chopped cilantro, diced onions, 
                diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sliced avocado, salsa, and sour cream.</li>
            <li>Serve the tacos with some lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor.</li>
        </ol>
