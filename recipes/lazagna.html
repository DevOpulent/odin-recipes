        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onion and minced garlic, 
                sauté until softened. Add ground beef, cook until browned. Stir in marinara sauce and Italian seasoning, 
                simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and the egg. 
                Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. 
                Place a layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles, 
                followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
                an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
